# mario_shapes

On the file there are multiple shapes that can be seen within the “Main()” part of the program. When the program begins it will ask multiple questions giving
first the option to add the shape and then to adjust the shape such as the height or size. You will then be asked to add flooring from a sizeable choice this
will be tiles of flooring to be added at the end of a shape.

Finally at the end of a program there will be a flag printed to mark the end of the program. 

There is a function called stairs() in the main part if you remove both '//' in front of it, you can then use this... this will allow you to use all the shapes
however, the twist is that it asks all of the questions first and then prints out the shapes after.
